abstract = {A growing body of research examines whether and how university research parks (URPs) enhance the performance of their tenants and foster regional innovation. As the findings in the literature are inconclusive, we argue that the URP construct requires closer conceptual examination, especially in regards to URP strategies. This paper highlights the limitations of treating URPs homogenously and theorizes how URPs' strategies vary and arise. We develop a conceptual model, a typology, based on URP's industry specialization and development services, of four types of URP strategies. The model shows how URP strategies can vary in theoretically important ways to generate URP internal and external strategic fit.},

abstract = {Innovation processes are influenced by the dynamics of expectations. This paper addresses the question of what happens after a hype. It takes a closer look at the case of stationary fuel cells, for which a hype could be identified in 2001 followed by a clear downscaling of expectations and disappointment. Innovation activities, however, remained largely unaffected by the disap- pointment.We offer two explanations. First, only generalised expectations were adjusted after the hype, while overarching expectations (frames) remained stable and continued to legitimate the technology. Second, emerging institutional structures lead to increasing positive external- ities thus stabilising ongoing innovation activities. These institutionalisation processes, again, were supported by a transformation of promises into requirements during the hype and the fact that the frames continued to legitimise the technology afterwards.We conclude with the proposition to differentiate disappointments according to which type of expectations changes after the hype.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an approach for creating and utilizing keyword-based patent maps for use in new technology creation activity. The proposed approach comprises the following sub-modules. First, text mining is used to transform patent documents into structured data to identify keyword vectors. Second, principal component analysis is employed to reduce the numbers of keyword vectors to make suitable for use on a two-dimensional map. Third, patent 'vacancies', defined as blank areas in the map that are sparse in patent density but large in size, are identified. The validity of the vacancy is then tested against such criteria as technological criticality and technological trends. If a vacancy is judged as meaningful, its technological features are investigated in detail to identify the potential for new technology creation. The procedure of the proposed approach is described in detail by employing an illustrative patent database and is implemented into an expert system for new technology creation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this paper, we compared structures of the citation network of scientific publications with those of patents, and discussed the differences between them. A case study was performed in a solar cell to develop a method of detecting gaps between science and technology. Scientific research has tended to be more basic, especially in terms of cell design, whereas patents have focused on more applied technology used in solar cell modules. Of the major citation clusters of scientific publications, only two, namely silicon and compound solar cells, corresponded semantically with patent clusters. Conversely, there were no patent clusters corresponding to the other two scientific research fronts, namely dye-sensitized and polymer solar cells. These research areas could be regarded as opportunities for industrial commercialization because scientific activities exist but not technological applications. Our results could offer an intellectual basis for discovering potential opportunities for industrial commercialization. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The interaction between scientific and technological knowledge facilitates exploration of new technological opportunities; however, gaps between them typically impede exploration of these opportunities. Scientific papers and technological patents record modern and advanced knowledge in scientific discovery and technological development; therefore, comparing their statuses can identify the gaps and explore potential technological opportunities. Because microalgal biofuels are a promising alternative energy resource devoid of territorial land use problems, this study applies text mining and an algorithm that can cluster objects of high-dimensional data to microalgal biofuel papers and patents, and explores their potential technological opportunities. The results demonstrate that a text-based clustering approach is appropriate for identifying scientific and technological applications for microalgal biofuels. The results indicate that microalgal photosynthesis and light utilization have abundant scientific outcomes for technological engineers to potentially apply. Technological opportunities exist in synthesis, harvesting, extraction, and lipid conversion. Scientific knowledge underlying biofuels accompanying high-value co-products of production require sustained exploration and reporting through research. These needs represent potential technological opportunities.},

Bibliometric tools can be used to detect such research hidden in a pile of papers and patents; however, the relationship between academic research and industrial technology development has not been well documented. In this paper, we introduced patent relatedness, which measures the semantic similarity of papers and patents, and conducted a case study on polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC). The results show that in an academic research area with a small number of papers, recent average publication year, low patent relatedness has a high potential to increase in subsequent years. Research areas are identified by clustering the citation network of academic papers, and their patent relatedness and time series variation were measured and analyzed. Our results showed that potential research areas were characterized by small but emerging features. Using these findings, we identified the potential PEFC research areas and the research capability of each country.},

@article{Dolci2014,
abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to analyze some Brazilian companies' use of the information technology portfolio management (ITPM) technique as an aid to their information technology (IT) investments management. Design/methodology/approach – It was carried out in five case studies in different Brazilian companies from several economic sectors which were using ITPM or were in the initial implementation phase. Eight interviews were conducted. The persons interviewed were high-level executives working in the IT department in the studied companies. Findings – Different levels of ITPM use was found with respect to IT investment management (planning, control and evaluation). It was observed, in the analyzed cases, that ITPM is used most frequently in IT investment planning, which is the process most discussed and used in analyzed companies. The ITPM technique is used more frequently in Company 2 than in the other cases because the organization of the IT area in the company is structured according to ITPM dimensions. Research limitations/implications – The ITPM technique has received little attention in IT research and research in this area identifying the use and applicability of ITPM in companies is still very limited in the information systems literature. Originality/value – The paper presents IT investment management in different Brazilian companies and how ITPM was used to help companies in this process compose by planning, control and evaluation.},

abstract = {Exchange between science and industry is a prerequisite for innovation (Kaufmann {\&} T{\"{o}}dtling, 2001; Pittaway, Robertson, Munir, Denyer {\&} Neely, 2004) and has attracted considerable interest to the role of relationships and interactions in the process of bringing ideas to the market and commercializing knowledge (Pittaway et al., 2004; Porter {\&} Ketels, 2003; Story, Hart {\&} O'Malley, 2009). Despite enormous government financing, artificially supporting the development of such collaborative partnerships has proved difficult. This study extends industrial marketing's B-2-B model by looking at public sector participants in collaborations in order to examine the process of establishing scientific-knowledge-commercialization collaborations. It is based on 82 interviews in 17 collaborative-research projects in both Ireland and Germany. The findings suggest that retention is a catalyst for improving established collaborations to facilitate the commercialization of scientific knowledge through repeated projects. Retention results from loyal collaborators. Collaborators become loyal and committed because they are content with the overall relationship, commercialization service and quality. It is fundamental that all collaborators understand each other's roles and motive as incongruities hamper the development of productive collaborations. In addition, universities need to develop a greater appreciation of the role of satisfaction. Overall, the study shows the importance of repeat collaborations and the development of mutual benefits which facilitate scientific knowledge commercialization. The study also demonstrates how contextual differences impact on scientific knowledge commercialization in both Ireland and Germany. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {In this paper, we performed a comparative study in two research domains in order to develop a method of detecting emerging knowledge domains. The selected domains are research on gallium nitride (GaN) and research on complex networks, which represent recent examples of innovative research. We divided citation networks into clusters using the topological clustering method, tracked the positions of papers in each cluster, and visualized citation networks with characteristic terms for each cluster. Analyzing the clustering results with the average age and parent-children relationship of each cluster may be helpful in detecting emergence. In addition, topological measures, within-cluster degree z and participation coefficient P, succeeded in determining whether there are emerging knowledge clusters. There were at least two types of development of knowledge domains. One is incremental innovation as in GaN and the other is branching innovation as in complex networks. In the domains where incremental innovation occurs, papers changed their position to large z and large P. On the other hand, in the case of branching innovation, they moved to a position with large z and small P, because there is a new emerging cluster, and active research centers shift rapidly. Our results showed that topological measures are beneficial in detecting branching innovation in the citation network of scientific publications. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Western economists long have touted competitive, profit-oriented, market-guided economies as powerful engines of technical progress. Economist Adam Smith thought so. Economist Karl Marx lauded capitalism for this attribute if not for others. Economist Joseph Schumpeter and his followers have hammered the point that this, rather than any tendencies toward Pareto optimality in a static sense, is the hallmark virtue of modem capitalism. It also is true that the capitalist engine is a much more complicated one than many economists seem to think. There is a lot more to the system than, simply, rivalrous for-profit business firms, and patents or alternative mechanisms for appropriating returns. There are, as well, modes of cooperation among firms and a variety of public institutions dedicated to the generation and spread of technological knowledge. This paper reports preliminary findings on the roles played by two such institutions, universities and technical societies. In capitalist economies, technology has two faces-a private and proprietary one, and a public and cooperative one. These at once complement each other, and are at odds. Patent law also recognizes these two sides. The inventor gains a limited temporary monopoly in exchange for disclosure that makes the know how public.},

abstract = {Since its introduction in the late nineteen eighties, the discipline of Enterprise Architecture (EA) has evolved into a well-known practice of managing information systems in alignment with business interests. The evolution of the discipline is reflected in the many available scientific publications. Within a timeframe of three decades, we identify approximately 4000 journal articles and conference papers of which enterprise architecture is a major topic. We conduct a holistic, systematic literature review using artificial intelligence technologies such as information retrieval, text mining and supervised learning, side-by-side with manually reading of many relevant articles. For the first time, we present a holistic historical overview of the scientific development of the discipline. We describe the current focus of enterprise architecture and make suggestions for future publications and conferences using predictive analytics. As a major result of our analysis, we find that the focus of EA research has shifted from understanding EA in the early years to managing EA today. Furthermore, we identify and investigate several current EA trend topics: We find Cloud Computing to be the trend with the strongest impact on EA and predict that this will be the case until 2020. According to our forecast, the Internet of Things will be the trend with the strongest growth in its impact on EA. Moreover, based on a comparison with the Gartner Hype Cycle, we observe a discrepancy between EA trends in academic work versus practical experiences, which presents a starting point for future research.},

Long after she returned to the U.S., Ann would continue to send articles to people she had met, read their papers and make insightful suggestions for improvement, and counsel international graduate students and professors. In her lectures, conversations, and comments on papers, she would often ask, ‘Where's the argument?” Those who had the pleasure of working with her began to look for the argument everywhere in academic texts including in the visuals. This paper attempts to show that visual as much as verbal elements vary according to genre. Visuals in Science and Newsweek will be analyzed using the systemic linguistic concepts of interpersonal, ideational and textual metafunctions. The relationship between the text and visual, between the gloss and the visual, and among the visuals themselves will be examined in the two genres. visuals in academic texts are mainly arguments, following formal conventions organized for maximum persuasion and immediate access to new information. Visual elements in the popular press, however, function largely to attract the reader to the article or explain rather than prove.},

abstract = {This paper presents a method for assessing whether members of two subcultures, in this case academics and practitioners, have influenced each other's interpretations. Conceptual and symbolic influence are seen as special instances of acculturation, and their occurrence can be studied by specifying changes in the language that members of different subcultures use to frame a topic or issue. Models of academic- and practitioner-oriented discourse on organizational culture were derived from early papers on the topic. The texts of 192 articles on organizational culture written between June 1975 and December 1984 were then examined for evidence of acculturation. The data strongly suggest that those who wrote for practitioners and academics initially conceptualized organizational culture differently. Over time, however, academics appear to have moved toward the practitioners' point of view, while the latter appear to have been little influenced by the former. Besides showing that it is possible to study acculturation by investigating language use, the analysis raises important questions about the links between theory and practice in organizational behavior.},

Failure to adequately address this problem can result in wasted organization resources in ac quiring, developing, managing, and training employees in the use of technologies that are short-lived and fail to produce adequate return on investment. The sheer number of avail able technologies and the complex set of relationships among them make IT landscape analysis extremely challenging. Most IT-consuming firms rely on third parties and suppliers for strategic recommendations on IT investments, which can lead to biased and generic advice. We address this problem by defining a new set of constructs and methodologies upon which we develop an IT ecosystem model The objective of these artifacts is to provide a formal problem representation structure for the analysis of information technology devel opment trends and to reduce the complexity of the IT landscape for practitioners making IT investment decisions.

It finds that, although there has been a rapid increase in the volume of university-industry collaborations since the 1980s, the biggest increases were before the major policy measures of the mid-1990s.

Each edition attempts to forecast the most promising technologies likely to impact on education along three horizons: the short term (the year of the report), the mid-term (the next 2 years) and the long term (the next 4 years). This paper analyzes the evolution of technology trends from 2004 to 2014 that correspond to the long-term predictions of the most recent Horizon Report. The study analyzes through bibliometric analysis which technologies were successful and became a regular part of education systems, which ones failed to have the predicted impact and why, and the shape of technology flows in recent years. The study also shows how the evolution and maturity of some technologies allowed the revival of expectations for others. The analysis here, which focuses on educational applications, offers guidelines that may be helpful to those seeking to invest in new research areas. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper provides a systematized overview of patterns in the scenario planning literature published in the last decades. Recently, scenario planning has enjoyed a revival, apparent in the 'boom' in published research on the matter. Consequently, a major issue that needs to be addressed is how to organize the literature along precise lines. A number of reviews that describe the current status of the body of literature and knowledge on scenario planning have made attempts to respond to such requirements. These studies agree that systematizing the existing literature is a necessary step in developing the field. This paper aims to contribute to this purpose. The review of the academic literature here conducted is thought to be useful for both academics and practitioners. For researchers, this systematic overview will be constructive not only in providing an analysis of the directions of published research but also in setting up a research agenda for the future. For managers and practitioners, it provides a clear outline of firm-related articles and discusses their contribution from a managerial point of view. It also raises awareness with regard to future analytical methods, and in particular, to scenario planning and its potential contribution to the competitiveness of firms.

This paper presents a longitudinal study of the link between firms' academic research activity and commercial exploration and exploitation of emerging technology knowledge. According to our findings, firms with an active program of publishing academic research are more likely to commercially explore (via pioneer products) and exploit (via greater product scope) their emerging technology investment.},

A review of Herman Kahn and Anthony Wiener's "One Hundred Technical Innovations Very Likely in the Last Third of the Twentieth Century," published in their 1967 book, The Year 2000, A Framework for Speculation on the Next Thirty-Three Years, found that fewer than 50{\%} were judged good and timely, having occurred in the twentieth century. However, when the forecasts were grouped into nine broad technological fields, there were wide variations in the judged accuracy of the forecasts. Forecasts in computers and communication stood out as about 80{\%} correct, while forecasts in all other fields were judged to be less than about 50{\%} correct. Sustained trends of increasing capabilities and declining costs of technologies used for computers and communication applications were apparent in 1967 and enabled accurate long-term forecasts. To improve our current forecasts, we should look for sustained and continuing trends in underlying technologies, where increasing capabilities enable more complex applications and declining costs drive a positive innovation loop, lowering the cost of innovation and enabling wider learning and contributions from more people, thus sustaining the technology trends. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {There has been much political and educational focus on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) in Australian schools in recent years and while there has been significant research examining science and mathematics enrolments in senior high school, little is known about the corresponding trends in Technologies and engineering. Understanding these subjects is essential for educators and policy-makers alike if Australians are to embrace the challenges of an innovation economy. We have collected raw enrolment data from each of the Australian state and territory education departments from 1992 to 2014 and analysed this across five Technology and Engineering subject areas. We also consider some of the relationships between these subject areas and other areas of the STEM equation. The results of these analyses are discussed in terms of absolute enrolments, participation rates and sex balance. We have found that the total number of students in Year 12 increased year on year and that this growth is echoed, to a lesser extent, in the participation rates for design technology, food technology and engineering. Digital Technologies however, grew rapidly until 2000, after which time it has been in steady decline. We identify that while the trends mostly show growth, there is a concerning male bias to many of these subject areas. We suggest that the broadening of the upper high school curriculum, confusion surrounding vocational training enrolments, and gamesmanship of the university entrance system, may be contributing to the limited growth observed. Finally, we identify a number of important areas for further research in this key learning area.},

These fashion setters-consulting firms, management gurus, business mass-media publica-tions, and business schools-do not simply force fashions onto gull-ible managers. To sustain their images as fashion setters, they must lead in a race (a) to sense the emergent collective preferences of man-agers for new management techniques, (b) to develop rhetorics that describe these techniques as the forefront of management progress, and (c) to disseminate these rhetorics back to managers and organi-zational stakeholders before other fashion setters. Fashion setters who fall behind in this race (e.g., business schools or certain schol-arly professional societies) are condemned to be perceived as lagging rather than leading management progress, as peripheral to the busi-ness community, and as undeserving of societal support. This article is not a plea for business school scholars to become slaves to man-agement fashion. Rather, it urges these scholars not only to study the management-fashion-setting process and to explain when and how it fails to serve shareholders, employees, managers, students, and other stakeholders, but also to intervene in this process in order to render it a more technically useful, collective learning process for these stakeholders.},

Results of the investigation show that the attractiveness of a given technology depends mainly on the potential impact of this technology on the competitive issues, the market volume and the span of applications it opens, its performance relative to other technologies, the competitive intensity of the technical area and, finally, the barriers to imitation. Results also show that technological competitiveness depends above all on the value of the 'applied research' and the 'development' teams' competencies, the relatedness of the technology to the company's core business, the time advantage vis-{\`{a}}-vis the competition and the potential for financing. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {This paper provides a systematic review of the current literature on technology commercialization. It serves to establish a foundation for the following empirical and theoretical contributions. Technological inventions are fundamental for a country's economic growth. However, in order to actually generate value for society and profits for the involved companies, these inventions need to be successfully transferred to the market. Therefore, newly developed technologies need to be integrated into products which sell. In particular, our study focuses on the different interaction channels through which technology commercialization occurs. We analyze main groups of institutions, which can either act as developers of technologies and/or organizations bringing these technologies to the market: Universities and research institutes, technology startups, and established companies. We propose a theoretical framework of possible interactions between these organizations and analyze the success factors within the respective channels. Based on the systematic review of 140 articles, key characteristics of the technology development organizations are analyzed with regard to the different possible channels available to commercialize their technology.},

The more frequently a certain patent is cited by subsequent patents, the more the related technology can be said to be diffused, implying that the technology is more widely applied and thus more valuable. This paper analyzes the business methods technology which retrieves patents from the USPTO database. There are two purposes of this paper: 1. establish the indicators for finding basic patents and measure the relationship of these basic patents; 2. classify the basic patents and explain the groups of technology diffusion. Finally, this study identifies the two mainstreams in business method technology: one is focused on marketing technology, and the other one stresses on data security.

abstract = {In the feasibility analysis of R{\&}D program, the data used to analyze the impact/trends/level of technology derive mostly from patents and theses. However, there is limitation in reflecting the newest technology trends data based on patents and theses. That is because of the occurrence of a one or two year gap time before these patents (or theses) are actually published or granted. Therefore, not only are related patents and theses data collected but, the extensive trends data from public websites and social networks also need to be collected and analyzed. It takes a great deal of time, and manpower for these related feasibility analysis to happen successfully. To solve this issue, this analysis presents a methodology not only to rapidly and accurately collect data but, to efficiently analyze the newest technology trend flows. To analyze technology impact, phases of the data extraction, the application of measuring model and the determination of TIIB (Technology Impact Index based on Big Data) are processed. This theses proposes that the data analysis methodology used to find out the latest technology trends could also be useful for optimizing efficiency when analyzing. Moreover, the newly developed TIIB enables us to check the interest trends of the technology by reading the yearly changes.},

abstract = {Short term forecasting was applied to 20 emerging technologies under the "Machine and Materials" category based on the Vision 2023 foresight study previously conducted for Turkey. This scientometric approach uses the most suitable keywords linked to the technology in question and determines the number of publications and patents in those fields for a given year. Database analysis of publications and patents in the previous 11 years indicates that while the majority of the top 20 technologies identified by the experts are indeed emerging (i.e. the number of research and/or patenting in these technologies is increasing), some of them have not actually attracted too much interest in the science and technology (S{\&}T) community. Forecasts based on S-curves indicate steady growth in some of the selected technologies. There is a high correlation between the number of scientific publications and patents in most of the technologies investigated. The method is proposed as a simple and efficient tool to link national foresight efforts to international S{\&}T activities and to obtain quantitative information for prioritized technologies that could be used for technology management and decision making for research funding and technology investment. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Confronted with increasing global economic competition, policy-makers and scientists are grappling with the problem of how to select the most promissing research areas and emerging technologies on which to target resources and, hence, derive the greatest benefits. This paper analyzes the experiences of Japan, the US, the Netherlands, Germany, Australia, New Zealand and the UK in using "foresight" to help in selecting and exploiting research that is likely to yield longer-term economic and social benefits. It puts forward a model of the foresight process for identifying research areas and technologies of strategic importance, and also analyzes why some foresight exercises have proved more successful than others. It concludes by drawing an analogy between models of innovation and foresight.},

The boundaries of technological systems may or may not coincide with national borders and may vary from one techno-industrial area to another. The central features of technological systems are economic competence (the ability to develop and exploit new business oppor- tunities), clustering of resources, and institutional infrastructure. A technological system is defined as a dynamic network of agents interacting in a specific eco- nomic/industrial area under a particular institutional infrastructure and involved in the generation, diffusion, and utilization of technology. Technological systems are defined in terms of knowledge/competence flows rather than flows of ordi- nary goods and services. In the presence of an entrepreneur and sufficient critical mass, such networks can be transformed into development blocks, i.e. synergistic clusters of firms and technologies which give rise to new business opportunities.

abstract = {This article examines the emerging 'technology transfer' role US academics are expected to play in economic development, what specific roles they believe they can play in industrial innovations, and how they might go about collaborating with private industry. Based on a national survey response of approximately 1000 faculty members at research-intensive universities it concludes that US academics in the 1990s believe that they are more favorably disposed than in the 1980s toward closer university-industry collaboration. A majority of the respondents supports the idea that their universities participate actively in local and regional economic development, facilitate commercialization of academic research, and encourage faculty consulting for private firms. A majority of these respondents, however, refuses to support the idea of their universities getting involved in close business partnership with private industry by way of, for example, start-up assistance or equity investment. Of various organizational and motivational underpinnings analyzed from the data, two factors stand out as central to the current debate on university transfer: one is the perception of declining federal R{\&}D support, which threatens the vitality of their research enterprise, and the other is the impact of close university-industry cooperation, which is likely to interfere with academic freedom - the freedom to pursue long-term, disinterested, fundamental research. A search for the boundaries of university-industry collaboration is, therefore, seen as a balancing act between these two competing concerns.},

abstract = {Many forms of technology cycle models have been developed and utilized to identify emergent technologies and forecast social changes, and among these, the technology hype cycle introduced by Gartner has become established as an effective method widely utilized in the field. However, if the hype cycle indeed exists in the various dimensions that constitute the socio-technical system, those who seek to analyze innovative activities using bibliometrics will be confronted with the new problem of actors' choices and the need to analyze their hype cycles. In seeking to overcome such limitations of conventional studies, this paper analyzes the hype cycles of three actors that constitute the core of the socio-technical system through the case study of the successful market entry of hybrid cars. The hype cycle of the user, the first actor, is analyzed based on the search traffic generated by their web searches, and the hype cycle of the producer or researcher, the second actor, is measured based on the data regarding patent applications. Lastly, the hype cycle of the information distributor, namely individuals constituting the market network, is analyzed by examining the exposure in news reports. The outcomes of this research showed that among the three actors, the consumers and the information distributors exhibited hype cycle patterns (bell curves) that were distinct from the market trend, and that there was a difference in time interval of around five quarters. By contrast, it was found that the hype cycle of the producers reflected a logical response, exhibiting a pattern similar to the S-curve during the market's growth period unlike the pattern found in other actors. In conclusion, this study of the particular case of hybrid cars confirmed that the two components of the hype cycle can be respectively verified using consumer search traffic and the patent applications made by the producers. If in the future, such analyses of the hype cycles of producers and consumers are expanded in application to various other industries, it will be possible to obtain more generalizable research outcomes. This is expected to contribute to determining technological life cycles or hype cycles with greater objectivity and efficacy, and furthermore to facilitate the systematic identification of promising technologies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The analysis of 1021 R{\&}D units, each distinguished by its main orientation towards either research or development work, reveals that research is concentrated in only five regions worldwide, while development is more globally dispersed. Our research is based on 290 research interviews and database research in 81 technology-intensive multinational companies. We identify two principal location rationales—access to markets and access to science—as the principal determinants for four trends that lead to four archetypes of R{\&}D internationalization: ‘national treasure', ‘market-driven', ‘technology-driven', and ‘global'. Their organizational evolution is characterized by four trends. The model is illustrated with short cases of international R{\&}D organization at Kubota, Schindler, Xerox, and Glaxo-Wellcome. Differences in R{\&}D internationalization drivers lead to a separation of individual R{\&}D units by geography and organization. Current belief is to integrate R{\&}D processes; separation seems to contradict this trend. We argue that this need not be the case, for there are good reasons to maintain some independence between research and development.},

After presenting Gartner's model and its strong immanent influence on large companies' technology strategy and investment decisions, we conduct an in-depth analysis of its two underlying theories, the expectation hype and the technology s-curves. In the next stage, we analyze a longitudinal combination of actual hype cycle reports for the energy and utility sector 2003–2009. Additionally we observe the 46 inherent technologies and their methodological treatment more closely. In a last step, the hype cycles results for three example technologies: tidal power, Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) and photovoltaic generation have been tested empirically in terms of visibility (news article count) and user interest (search requests). Based on comparing the empirical results with the current methodological set up and the analysis procedure of Gartner's hype cycle model, we must strongly criticize the existing approach. We suggest to improve the hype cycle methodology by introducing an underlying mathematical model relation that would enable Gartner to quantitatively operationalized their analyses. Theoretical and empirically devised observations, propositions and aims for future research are elaborated throughout the paper and summarized in the last section.},

Indications are that a wave of major technological advances seems likely to arrive during the next 3 decades. Highly important technological innovations are occurring in all fields, and most of the new technologies under study will arrive between the years 2003 and 2025. The George Washington University Forecast of Emerging Technologies works on the theory that information technology serves as the principal factor now driving the Technology Revolution. Technological predictions are presented by decade, from 2001 through 2030.},

abstract = {Rapid changes in Science {\&} Technology (S{\&}T) along with breakthroughs in products and services concern a great deal of policy and strategy makers and lead to an ever increasing number of Foresight and other types of forward-looking work. At the outset, the purpose of these efforts is to investigate emerging S{\&}T areas, set priorities and inform policies and strategies. However, there is still no clear evidence on the mutual linkage between science and strategy, which may be attributed to Foresight and S{\&}T policy making activities. The present paper attempts to test the hypothesis that both science and strategy affect each other and this linkage can be investigated quantitatively. The evidence for the mutual attribution of science and strategy is built on a quantitative trend monitoring process drawing on semantic analysis of large amount of textual data and text mining tools. Based on the proposed methodology the similarities between science and strategy documents along with the overlaps between them across a certain period of time are calculated using the case of the Agriculture and Food sector, and thus the linkages between science and strategy are investigated.},

abstract = {Business decisions often depend on a good understanding of the maturity and evolution of technologies. There are many ways to gain this understanding — for example, by using the performance S-curve and adoption curve models. However, they do not provide information about the early stages of a technology's life cycle and how it may evolve. Gartner's Hype Cycle model adds another dimension to technology life cycle models: it characterizes the typical progression of an emerging technology from user and media overenthusiasm through a period of disillusionment to an eventual understanding of the technology's relevance and role in a market or domain. Hype Cycles allow technology planners to compare their understanding of technologies' evolution against Gartner's analysis of the technologies' maturity. An important Hype Cycle lesson is that enterprises should not invest in technologies just because the technologies are being hyped. Enterprises also should not ignore technologies just because the technologies currently are not living up to early overexpectations.},

This approach alleviates the sample selection problems associated with prior entry research.

Before the mid-1980s, university patents were more highly cited, and were cited by more diverse patents, than a random sample of all patents. More recently several significant shifts in university patenting behavior have led to the disappearance of this difference. Thus our results suggest that between 1965 and 1988 the rate of increase of important patents from universities was much less than their overall rate of increase of patenting.},

abstract = {One of the key challenges in commercializing inventions arising from academic research is deciding on an appropriate business model for transferring the invention from the academic world to the commercial world. However, there is little empirical evidence to suggest which model to choose. This study attempts to address this gap by examining how characteristics of technologies affect the selection of business models. We consider four characteristics of technology: patent or other legal protection, specialized complementary assets, commercial uncertainty and technological dynamism. We relate these characteristics to the choice of three basic business models for commercializing inventions. Data for this study were gathered for 42 commercialized inventions. We found evidence that greater patent or other legal protection for the technology was associated with a greater likelihood that the technology was commercialized by transferring limited rights to the technology to existing firms. We also found evidence that greater commercial uncertainty was associated with a greater likelihood that the technology was commercialized by creation of a new firm or transfer of the rights to the technology to an existing firm. We did not find evidence of a relationship between the importance of specialized complementary assets or technological dynamism and the business model used. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The evidence supports the broad interpretation that we call the 'Stanford-Yale-Sussex' synthesis. Second, such patterns yield important implications with respect to the so-called 'European Paradox', i.e. the conjecture that EU countries play a leading global role in terms of top-level scientific output, but lag behind in the ability of converting this strength into wealth-generating innovations. Some descriptive evidence shows that, contrary to the 'paradox' conjecture, Europe's weaknesses reside both in its system of scientific research and in a relatively weak industry. The final part of the paper identifies a few normative implications: much less emphasis should be put on various types of 'networking', and much more on policy measures aimed at strengthening both frontier research and European corporate actors. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Chen2006,
abstract = {This article describes the latest development of a generic approach to detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature. The work makes substantial theoretical and methodological contributions to progressive knowledge domain visualization. A specialty is conceptualized and visualized as a time-variant duality between two fundamental concepts in information science: research fronts and intellectual bases. A research front is defined as an emergent and transient grouping of concepts and underlying research issues. The intellectual base of a research front is its citation and co-citation footprint in scientific literature - an evolving network of scientific publications cited by research-front concepts. Kleinberg's (2002) burst-detection algorithm is adapted to identify emergent research-front concepts. Freeman's (1979) betweenness centrality metric is used to highlight potential pivotal points of paradigm shift over time. Two complementary visualization views are designed and implemented: cluster views and time-zone views. The contributions of the approach are that (a) the nature of an intellectual base is algorithmically and temporally identified by emergent research-front terms, (b) the value of a co-citation cluster is explicitly interpreted in terms of research-front concepts, and (c) visually prominent and algorithmically detected pivotal points substantially reduce the complexity of a visualized network. The modeling and visualization process is implemented in CiteSpace II, a Java application, and applied to the analysis of two research fields: mass extinction (1981-2004) and terrorism (1990-2003). Prominent trends and pivotal points in visualized networks were verified in collaboration with domain experts, who are the authors of pivotal-point articles. Practical implications of the work are discussed. A number of challenges and opportunities for future studies are identified.},

abstract = {For a young, resource-constrained, technology-based start-up embarking on international sales, the choice of entry mode is a strategic decision of major importance. Yet within the emerging research stream of international entrepreneurship, curiously little attention has been devoted to the empirical analysis of foreign market entry forms. The authors address this important issue by analyzing the determinants of 398 export decisions taken from a U.K. survey of 246 technology-based start-ups with international activities. The findings show that the entry mode decision is necessarily a trade-off between the resources available and the support requirements of the customer. Issues of the innovativeness of the technology and the historic channel experience of the firm in its domestic market are particularly strong determinants of mode choice. The authors suggest that an organizational capability perspective on these firms' behavior offers a better explanation of their entry decisions than either transaction cost or stage theory.

@article{Gruber2008,
abstract = {Entrepreneurs play a fundamental role in bringing new technologies to market. Because technologies are often configurable to serve a variety of different markets, it is possible for entrepreneurs to identify multiple market opportunities prior to the first market entry of their emerging firms, and if they elect to do so, to therefore have a choice of which market to enter first. The empirical results presented in this paper offer three new insights regarding this important early-stage choice in new firm creation. First, they reveal that serial entrepreneurs have learned through prior start-up experience to generate a " choice set " of alternative market opportunities before deciding which one to pursue in their new firm creation. Second, the analysis indicates that entrepreneurs who identify a " choice set " of market opportunities prior to first entry derive performance benefits by doing so. Third, the positive relationship between the number of market opportunities identified prior to first entry and new firm performance is nonlinear and subject to decreasing marginal return. The research literature has yet to acknowledge the notion of multiple opportunity identification prior to entry, and the related idea of selecting the most favorable market opportunity for the creation of a new technology firm.},

Moreover, the citation records of papers do not reflect duly their sci-entific quality enhancing mere quantity. The growth of sophisticated " push-and-button " apparatuses allows easier preparation of publications while facilitating ready-to-publish data. Articles can thus be compiled by mere combination of different measurements usually without idea what it all is about and to what purpose this may serve. Moreover, any deep-rooted theory which is contravening mainstream executions is not welcome because is breaking the effortless often long-established practice. While the number of publications is clearly a quantitative criterion, much hopes has been placed on citation, which promised to serve well as an adequate measure of the genuine scientific value, i.e., of quality of the scientific work. The impact factor is related to the van't Hoff law of activity coefficient. The case of Russian publication policy and that of JTAC are particularly examined. JTAC is enlightened by pro-viding basis for new fields of thermal material science which should be recognized as a yet missing impact.},

abstract = {Judging by the large R{\&}D-active companies that have slimmed down their research labs in recent years, it would seem that corporate research is increasingly managed as an economic asset that is predominantly driven by market forces and ruled by IPR strategies. Has this development significantly affected industry's basic research and interactions with research communities in the public sector? This paper examines the global trends in an underdeveloped source of information on corporate science: their research articles published in the international scientific and technical journals. Statistical analysis of some 290,000 corporate research articles published in 1996-2001 indicate that, contrary to large increases in patenting and growth in patent citations to research literature, the numbers of research articles that list author affiliate addresses in the corporate sector have declined steadily, especially for those articles authored exclusively by industrial researchers. More detailed analysis of trends in the bio-pharmaceuticals sector and semiconductors sector show sector-specific publication trends and patterns related to specifics of their innovation processes. Overall, these observations provide factual evidence indicating that corporate research is in an on-going process of structural change characterised by a stronger emphasis on the appropriation and commercialisation of in-house research results. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The hype cycle model traces the evolution of technological innovations as they pass through successive stages pronounced by the peak, disappointment, and recovery of expectations. Since its introduction by Gartner nearly two decades ago, the model has received growing interest from practitioners, and more recently from scholars. Given the model's proclaimed capacity to forecast technological development, an important consideration for organizations in formulating marketing strategies, this paper provides a critical review of the hype cycle model by seeking evidence from Gartner's own technology databases for the manifestation of hype cycles. The results of our empirical work show incongruences connected with the reports of Gartner, which motivates us to consider possible future directions, whereby the notion of hype or hyped dynamics (though not necessarily the hype cycle model itself) can be captured in existing life cycle models through the identification of peak, disappointment, and recovery patterns.},

abstract = {A major problem for firms making information technology investment decisions is predicting and understanding the effects of future technological developments on the value of present technologies. Failure to adequately address this problem can result in wasted organization resources in ac-quiring, developing, managing, and training employees in the use of technologies that are short-lived and fail to produce adequate return on investment. The sheer number of avail-able technologies and the complex set of relationships among them make IT landscape analysis extremely challenging. Most IT-consuming firms rely on third parties and suppliers for strategic recommendations on IT investments, which can lead to biased and generic advice. We address this problem by defining a new set of constructs and methodologies upon which we develop an IT ecosystem model. The objective of these artifacts is to provide a formal problem representation structure for the analysis of information technology devel-opment trends and to reduce the complexity of the IT landscape for practitioners making IT investment decisions. We adopt a process theory perspective and use a combination MIS Quarterly Vol. 32 No. 4, pp. 779-809/December 2008 779 Adomavicius et al./Technology Trends in the IT Landscape of visual mapping and quantification strategies to develop our artifacts and a state diagram-based technique to repre-sent evolutionary transitions over time. We illustrate our approach using two exemplars: digital music technologies and wireless networking technologies. We evaluate the utility of our approach by conducting in-depth interviews with IT industry experts and demonstrate the contribution of our approach relative to existing techniques for technology forecasting.},

abstract = {Technology roadmapping is a flexible technique that is widely used within industry to support strategic and long-range planning. The approach provides a structured (and often graphical) means for exploring and communicating the relationships between evolving and developing markets, products and technologies over time. It is proposed that the roadmapping technique can help companies survive in turbulent environments by providing a focus for scanning the environment and a means of tracking the performance of individual, including potentially disruptive, technologies. Technology roadmaps are deceptively simple in terms of format, but their development poses significant challenges. In particular the scope is generally broad, covering a number of complex conceptual and human interactions. This paper provides an overview of the origins of technology roadmapping, by means of a brief review of the technology and knowledge management foundations of the technique in the context of the fields of technology strategy and technology transitions. The rapidly increasing literature on roadmapping itself is presented in terms of a taxonomy for classifying roadmaps, in terms of both organizational purpose and graphical format. This illustrates the flexibility of the approach but highlights a key gap-a robust process for technology roadmapping. A fast-start method for technology roadmapping developed by the authors is introduced and described. Developed in collaboration with industry, this method provides a means for improved understanding of the architecture of roadmaps and for rapidly initiating roadmapping in a variety of organizational contexts. This paper considers the use of the roadmaps from two main perspectives. The first is a company perspective: roadmaps that allow technology developments to be integrated with business planning, and the impact of new technologies and market developments to be assessed. The second perspective is multiorganizational: roadmaps that seek to capture the environmental landscape, threats and opportunities for a particular group of stakeholders in a technology or application area. Two short illustrative cases show the fast-start method in use in the context of disruptive technological trends from these two perspectives. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Bucchi1996,
abstract = {This paper argues that both the traditional normative models and the more refined (‘continuity') models of public communication of science fail to account adequately for cases of ‘deviation', i.e. those cases when scientists address the public directly by skipping the usual stages of scientific communication. It is hypothesized that most of such cases are related to crisis situations and to the definition of scientific boundaries. Therefore, at least two modalities of public communication of science should be distinguished: one is the routine, generally unproblematic itinerary of a scientific idea through the different levels of communication as presented by the continuity models; and the other is the dramatic (re)assessment of boundaries and professional competences in the public arena that is required by marginal situations. Continuity models need to be supplemented by a multilevel, multivariate model which enables us to explain this second modality and to understand in more detail the role that the level of public communication plays when such a modality is activated.},

Patent citation data are used to measure 'technological overlap' between firms before and after alliance formation. Our results provide support for the resource-based view of the firm.

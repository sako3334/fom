abstract = {Many studies have demonstrated that academic research plays an important role in the development of emerging technologies. Publishing academic research, research by scientists that is shared with the broader research community via journal publications and conference presentations, plays an important role in the development of emerging technologies. While much is known about the relationship between academic research and invention capability (e.g., patent-generation capability), the link between academic research and commercial products demands further investigation. This paper presents a longitudinal study of the link between firms' academic research activity and commercial exploration and exploitation of emerging technology knowledge. According to our findings, firms with an active program of publishing academic research are more likely to commercially explore (via pioneer products) and exploit (via greater product scope) their emerging technology investment.},

abstract = {In this paper, we compared structures of the citation network of scientific publications with those of patents, and discussed the differences between them. A case study was performed in a solar cell to develop a method of detecting gaps between science and technology. Scientific research has tended to be more basic, especially in terms of cell design, whereas patents have focused on more applied technology used in solar cell modules. Of the major citation clusters of scientific publications, only two, namely silicon and compound solar cells, corresponded semantically with patent clusters. Conversely, there were no patent clusters corresponding to the other two scientific research fronts, namely dye-sensitized and polymer solar cells. These research areas could be regarded as opportunities for industrial commercialization because scientific activities exist but not technological applications. Our results could offer an intellectual basis for discovering potential opportunities for industrial commercialization. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {One of the key challenges in commercializing inventions arising from academic research is deciding on an appropriate business model for transferring the invention from the academic world to the commercial world. However, there is little empirical evidence to suggest which model to choose. This study attempts to address this gap by examining how characteristics of technologies affect the selection of business models. We consider four characteristics of technology: patent or other legal protection, specialized complementary assets, commercial uncertainty and technological dynamism. We relate these characteristics to the choice of three basic business models for commercializing inventions. Data for this study were gathered for 42 commercialized inventions. We found evidence that greater patent or other legal protection for the technology was associated with a greater likelihood that the technology was commercialized by transferring limited rights to the technology to existing firms. We also found evidence that greater commercial uncertainty was associated with a greater likelihood that the technology was commercialized by creation of a new firm or transfer of the rights to the technology to an existing firm. We did not find evidence of a relationship between the importance of specialized complementary assets or technological dynamism and the business model used. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Research and development are subject to different location drivers. The analysis of 1021 R{\&}D units, each distinguished by its main orientation towards either research or development work, reveals that research is concentrated in only five regions worldwide, while development is more globally dispersed. Our research is based on 290 research interviews and database research in 81 technology-intensive multinational companies. We identify two principal location rationales—access to markets and access to science—as the principal determinants for four trends that lead to four archetypes of R{\&}D internationalization: ‘national treasure', ‘market-driven', ‘technology-driven', and ‘global'. Their organizational evolution is characterized by four trends. The model is illustrated with short cases of international R{\&}D organization at Kubota, Schindler, Xerox, and Glaxo-Wellcome. Differences in R{\&}D internationalization drivers lead to a separation of individual R{\&}D units by geography and organization. Current belief is to integrate R{\&}D processes; separation seems to contradict this trend. We argue that this need not be the case, for there are good reasons to maintain some independence between research and development.},

The more frequently a certain patent is cited by subsequent patents, the more the related technology can be said to be diffused, implying that the technology is more widely applied and thus more valuable. This paper analyzes the business methods technology which retrieves patents from the USPTO database. There are two purposes of this paper: 1. establish the indicators for finding basic patents and measure the relationship of these basic patents; 2. classify the basic patents and explain the groups of technology diffusion. Finally, this study identifies the two mainstreams in business method technology: one is focused on marketing technology, and the other one stresses on data security. Both are important for Internet data processes or e-commerce activities. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Past forecasts of technical innovations include lessons that can be used in making forecasts today. A review of Herman Kahn and Anthony Wiener's "One Hundred Technical Innovations Very Likely in the Last Third of the Twentieth Century," published in their 1967 book, The Year 2000, A Framework for Speculation on the Next Thirty-Three Years, found that fewer than 50{\%} were judged good and timely, having occurred in the twentieth century. However, when the forecasts were grouped into nine broad technological fields, there were wide variations in the judged accuracy of the forecasts. Forecasts in computers and communication stood out as about 80{\%} correct, while forecasts in all other fields were judged to be less than about 50{\%} correct. Sustained trends of increasing capabilities and declining costs of technologies used for computers and communication applications were apparent in 1967 and enabled accurate long-term forecasts. To improve our current forecasts, we should look for sustained and continuing trends in underlying technologies, where increasing capabilities enable more complex applications and declining costs drive a positive innovation loop, lowering the cost of innovation and enabling wider learning and contributions from more people, thus sustaining the technology trends. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Scientific papers and technological patents record modern and advanced knowledge in scientific discovery and technological development; therefore, comparing their statuses can identify the gaps and explore potential technological opportunities. Because microalgal biofuels are a promising alternative energy resource devoid of territorial land use problems, this study applies text mining and an algorithm that can cluster objects of high-dimensional data to microalgal biofuel papers and patents, and explores their potential technological opportunities. The results demonstrate that a text-based clustering approach is appropriate for identifying scientific and technological applications for microalgal biofuels. The results indicate that microalgal photosynthesis and light utilization have abundant scientific outcomes for technological engineers to potentially apply. Technological opportunities exist in synthesis, harvesting, extraction, and lipid conversion. Scientific knowledge underlying biofuels accompanying high-value co-products of production require sustained exploration and reporting through research.

abstract = {A major problem for firms making information technology investment decisions is predicting and understanding the effects of future technological developments on the value of present technologies. Failure to adequately address this problem can result in wasted organization resources in ac-quiring, developing, managing, and training employees in the use of technologies that are short-lived and fail to produce adequate return on investment. The sheer number of avail-able technologies and the complex set of relationships among them make IT landscape analysis extremely challenging. Most IT-consuming firms rely on third parties and suppliers for strategic recommendations on IT investments, which can lead to biased and generic advice. We address this problem by defining a new set of constructs and methodologies upon which we develop an IT ecosystem model. The objective of these artifacts is to provide a formal problem representation structure for the analysis of information technology devel-opment trends and to reduce the complexity of the IT landscape for practitioners making IT investment decisions.

abstract = {Emerging generic technologies seem set to make a revolutionary impact on the economy and society. However, success in developing such technologies depends upon advances in science. Confronted with increasing global economic competition, policy-makers and scientists are grappling with the problem of how to select the most promissing research areas and emerging technologies on which to target resources and, hence, derive the greatest benefits. This paper analyzes the experiences of Japan, the US, the Netherlands, Germany, Australia, New Zealand and the UK in using "foresight" to help in selecting and exploiting research that is likely to yield longer-term economic and social benefits. It puts forward a model of the foresight process for identifying research areas and technologies of strategic importance, and also analyzes why some foresight exercises have proved more successful than others. It concludes by drawing an analogy between models of innovation and foresight.},

abstract = {In this paper, we performed a comparative study in two research domains in order to develop a method of detecting emerging knowledge domains. The selected domains are research on gallium nitride (GaN) and research on complex networks, which represent recent examples of innovative research. We divided citation networks into clusters using the topological clustering method, tracked the positions of papers in each cluster, and visualized citation networks with characteristic terms for each cluster. Analyzing the clustering results with the average age and parent-children relationship of each cluster may be helpful in detecting emergence. In addition, topological measures, within-cluster degree z and participation coefficient P, succeeded in determining whether there are emerging knowledge clusters. There were at least two types of development of knowledge domains. One is incremental innovation as in GaN and the other is branching innovation as in complex networks. In the domains where incremental innovation occurs, papers changed their position to large z and large P. On the other hand, in the case of branching innovation, they moved to a position with large z and small P, because there is a new emerging cluster, and active research centers shift rapidly. Our results showed that topological measures are beneficial in detecting branching innovation in the citation network of scientific publications. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper proposes an approach for creating and utilizing keyword-based patent maps for use in new technology creation activity. The proposed approach comprises the following sub-modules. First, text mining is used to transform patent documents into structured data to identify keyword vectors. Second, principal component analysis is employed to reduce the numbers of keyword vectors to make suitable for use on a two-dimensional map. Third, patent 'vacancies', defined as blank areas in the map that are sparse in patent density but large in size, are identified. The validity of the vacancy is then tested against such criteria as technological criticality and technological trends. If a vacancy is judged as meaningful, its technological features are investigated in detail to identify the potential for new technology creation. The procedure of the proposed approach is described in detail by employing an illustrative patent database and is implemented into an expert system for new technology creation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Exchange between science and industry is a prerequisite for innovation (Kaufmann {\&} T{\"{o}}dtling, 2001; Pittaway, Robertson, Munir, Denyer {\&} Neely, 2004) and has attracted considerable interest to the role of relationships and interactions in the process of bringing ideas to the market and commercializing knowledge (Pittaway et al., 2004; Porter {\&} Ketels, 2003; Story, Hart {\&} O'Malley, 2009). Despite enormous government financing, artificially supporting the development of such collaborative partnerships has proved difficult. This study extends industrial marketing's B-2-B model by looking at public sector participants in collaborations in order to examine the process of establishing scientific-knowledge-commercialization collaborations. It is based on 82 interviews in 17 collaborative-research projects in both Ireland and Germany. The findings suggest that retention is a catalyst for improving established collaborations to facilitate the commercialization of scientific knowledge through repeated projects. Retention results from loyal collaborators. Collaborators become loyal and committed because they are content with the overall relationship, commercialization service and quality. It is fundamental that all collaborators understand each other's roles and motive as incongruities hamper the development of productive collaborations. In addition, universities need to develop a greater appreciation of the role of satisfaction. Overall, the study shows the importance of repeat collaborations and the development of mutual benefits which facilitate scientific knowledge commercialization. The study also demonstrates how contextual differences impact on scientific knowledge commercialization in both Ireland and Germany. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Bibliometric tools can be used to detect such research hidden in a pile of papers and patents; however, the relationship between academic research and industrial technology development has not been well documented. In this paper, we introduced patent relatedness, which measures the semantic similarity of papers and patents, and conducted a case study on polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC). The results show that in an academic research area with a small number of papers, recent average publication year, low patent relatedness has a high potential to increase in subsequent years. Research areas are identified by clustering the citation network of academic papers, and their patent relatedness and time series variation were measured and analyzed. Our results showed that potential research areas were characterized by small but emerging features. Using these findings, we identified the potential PEFC research areas and the research capability of each country.},

It takes a closer look at the case of stationary fuel cells, for which a hype could be identified in 2001 followed by a clear downscaling of expectations and disappointment. Innovation activities, however, remained largely unaffected by the disap- pointment.We offer two explanations. First, only generalised expectations were adjusted after the hype, while overarching expectations (frames) remained stable and continued to legitimate the technology. Second, emerging institutional structures lead to increasing positive external- ities thus stabilising ongoing innovation activities. These institutionalisation processes, again, were supported by a transformation of promises into requirements during the hype and the fact that the frames continued to legitimise the technology afterwards.We conclude with the proposition to differentiate disappointments according to which type of expectations changes after the hype.},

Each edition attempts to forecast the most promising technologies likely to impact on education along three horizons: the short term (the year of the report), the mid-term (the next 2 years) and the long term (the next 4 years). This paper analyzes the evolution of technology trends from 2004 to 2014 that correspond to the long-term predictions of the most recent Horizon Report. The study analyzes through bibliometric analysis which technologies were successful and became a regular part of education systems, which ones failed to have the predicted impact and why, and the shape of technology flows in recent years. The study also shows how the evolution and maturity of some technologies allowed the revival of expectations for others. The analysis here, which focuses on educational applications, offers guidelines that may be helpful to those seeking to invest in new research areas. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Short term forecasting was applied to 20 emerging technologies under the "Machine and Materials" category based on the Vision 2023 foresight study previously conducted for Turkey. This scientometric approach uses the most suitable keywords linked to the technology in question and determines the number of publications and patents in those fields for a given year. Database analysis of publications and patents in the previous 11 years indicates that while the majority of the top 20 technologies identified by the experts are indeed emerging (i.e. the number of research and/or patenting in these technologies is increasing), some of them have not actually attracted too much interest in the science and technology (S{\&}T) community. Forecasts based on S-curves indicate steady growth in some of the selected technologies. There is a high correlation between the number of scientific publications and patents in most of the technologies investigated. The method is proposed as a simple and efficient tool to link national foresight efforts to international S{\&}T activities and to obtain quantitative information for prioritized technologies that could be used for technology management and decision making for research funding and technology investment. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {For the most part, the " publish or perish " para-digm has inevitable implications on the quality of research published because the scientific results are evaluated by quantity and not by quality. The pressure for multiple publication results in creation of so-called predators jour-nals acting without the required peer reviving. Moreover, the citation records of papers do not reflect duly their sci-entific quality enhancing mere quantity. The growth of sophisticated " push-and-button " apparatuses allows easier preparation of publications while facilitating ready-to-publish data. Articles can thus be compiled by mere combination of different measurements usually without idea what it all is about and to what purpose this may serve. Moreover, any deep-rooted theory which is contravening mainstream executions is not welcome because is breaking the effortless often long-established practice. While the number of publications is clearly a quantitative criterion, much hopes has been placed on citation, which promised to serve well as an adequate measure of the genuine scientific value, i.e., of quality of the scientific work. The impact factor is related to the van't Hoff law of activity coefficient. The case of Russian publication policy and that of JTAC are particularly examined. JTAC is enlightened by pro-viding basis for new fields of thermal material science which should be recognized as a yet missing impact.},

This paper uses joint scientific publications as an indicator of such collaborations in the UK over 20 years. It finds that, although there has been a rapid increase in the volume of university-industry collaborations since the 1980s, the biggest increases were before the major policy measures of the mid-1990s. An important factor would appear to be the growing need for firms, especially non-British firms, to collaborate with leading-edge academic research in promising areas of new technology.},

abstract = {I have had the honor and pleasure of working with Ann Johns in five countries on four continents, a representative sample to speak of her wide and deep influence on English for Specific Purposes. For hundreds of ESP professionals around the world, Ann has been a model of scholarly knowledge, generosity, energy, and enthusiasm. Ann not only introduced many of us to the mysteries of ESP and discourse analysis but acted as a lifeline and window to the academic world. Long after she returned to the U.S., Ann would continue to send articles to people she had met, read their papers and make insightful suggestions for improvement, and counsel international graduate students and professors. In her lectures, conversations, and comments on papers, she would often ask, ‘Where's the argument?” Those who had the pleasure of working with her began to look for the argument everywhere in academic texts including in the visuals. This paper attempts to show that visual as much as verbal elements vary according to genre. Visuals in Science and Newsweek will be analyzed using the systemic linguistic concepts of interpersonal, ideational and textual metafunctions. The relationship between the text and visual, between the gloss and the visual, and among the visuals themselves will be examined in the two genres. visuals in academic texts are mainly arguments, following formal conventions organized for maximum persuasion and immediate access to new information. Visual elements in the popular press, however, function largely to attract the reader to the article or explain rather than prove.},

abstract = {A major problem for firms making information technology investment decisions is predicting and understanding the effects of future technological developments on the value of present technologies. Failure to adequately address this problem can result in wasted organization resources in ac quiring, developing, managing, and training employees in the use of technologies that are short-lived and fail to produce adequate return on investment. The sheer number of avail able technologies and the complex set of relationships among them make IT landscape analysis extremely challenging. Most IT-consuming firms rely on third parties and suppliers for strategic recommendations on IT investments, which can lead to biased and generic advice. We address this problem by defining a new set of constructs and methodologies upon which we develop an IT ecosystem model The objective of these artifacts is to provide a formal problem representation structure for the analysis of information technology devel opment trends and to reduce the complexity of the IT landscape for practitioners making IT investment decisions.

abstract = {Management fashion setters disseminate management fashions, transitory collective beliefs that certain management techniques are at the forefront of management progress. These fashion setters-consulting firms, management gurus, business mass-media publica-tions, and business schools-do not simply force fashions onto gull-ible managers. To sustain their images as fashion setters, they must lead in a race (a) to sense the emergent collective preferences of man-agers for new management techniques, (b) to develop rhetorics that describe these techniques as the forefront of management progress, and (c) to disseminate these rhetorics back to managers and organi-zational stakeholders before other fashion setters. Fashion setters who fall behind in this race (e.g., business schools or certain schol-arly professional societies) are condemned to be perceived as lagging rather than leading management progress, as peripheral to the busi-ness community, and as undeserving of societal support. This article is not a plea for business school scholars to become slaves to man-agement fashion. Rather, it urges these scholars not only to study the management-fashion-setting process and to explain when and how it fails to serve shareholders, employees, managers, students, and other stakeholders, but also to intervene in this process in order to render it a more technically useful, collective learning process for these stakeholders.},

abstract = {This paper argues that both the traditional normative models and the more refined (‘continuity') models of public communication of science fail to account adequately for cases of ‘deviation', i.e. those cases when scientists address the public directly by skipping the usual stages of scientific communication. It is hypothesized that most of such cases are related to crisis situations and to the definition of scientific boundaries. Therefore, at least two modalities of public communication of science should be distinguished: one is the routine, generally unproblematic itinerary of a scientific idea through the different levels of communication as presented by the continuity models; and the other is the dramatic (re)assessment of boundaries and professional competences in the public arena that is required by marginal situations. Continuity models need to be supplemented by a multilevel, multivariate model which enables us to explain this second modality and to understand in more detail the role that the level of public communication plays when such a modality is activated.},

The boundaries of technological systems may or may not coincide with national borders and may vary from one techno-industrial area to another. The central features of technological systems are economic competence (the ability to develop and exploit new business oppor- tunities), clustering of resources, and institutional infrastructure. A technological system is defined as a dynamic network of agents interacting in a specific eco- nomic/industrial area under a particular institutional infrastructure and involved in the generation, diffusion, and utilization of technology. Technological systems are defined in terms of knowledge/competence flows rather than flows of ordi- nary goods and services. In the presence of an entrepreneur and sufficient critical mass, such networks can be transformed into development blocks, i.e. synergistic clusters of firms and technologies which give rise to new business opportunities.

abstract = {Business decisions often depend on a good understanding of the maturity and evolution of technologies. There are many ways to gain this understanding — for example, by using the performance S-curve and adoption curve models. However, they do not provide information about the early stages of a technology's life cycle and how it may evolve. Gartner's Hype Cycle model adds another dimension to technology life cycle models: it characterizes the typical progression of an emerging technology from user and media overenthusiasm through a period of disillusionment to an eventual understanding of the technology's relevance and role in a market or domain. Hype Cycles allow technology planners to compare their understanding of technologies' evolution against Gartner's analysis of the technologies' maturity. An important Hype Cycle lesson is that enterprises should not invest in technologies just because the technologies are being hyped. Enterprises also should not ignore technologies just because the technologies currently are not living up to early overexpectations.},

The evidence supports the broad interpretation that we call the 'Stanford-Yale-Sussex' synthesis. Second, such patterns yield important implications with respect to the so-called 'European Paradox', i.e. the conjecture that EU countries play a leading global role in terms of top-level scientific output, but lag behind in the ability of converting this strength into wealth-generating innovations. Some descriptive evidence shows that, contrary to the 'paradox' conjecture, Europe's weaknesses reside both in its system of scientific research and in a relatively weak industry. The final part of the paper identifies a few normative implications: much less emphasis should be put on various types of 'networking', and much more on policy measures aimed at strengthening both frontier research and European corporate actors. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This paper examines the global trends in an underdeveloped source of information on corporate science: their research articles published in the international scientific and technical journals. Statistical analysis of some 290,000 corporate research articles published in 1996-2001 indicate that, contrary to large increases in patenting and growth in patent citations to research literature, the numbers of research articles that list author affiliate addresses in the corporate sector have declined steadily, especially for those articles authored exclusively by industrial researchers. More detailed analysis of trends in the bio-pharmaceuticals sector and semiconductors sector show sector-specific publication trends and patterns related to specifics of their innovation processes. Overall, these observations provide factual evidence indicating that corporate research is in an on-going process of structural change characterised by a stronger emphasis on the appropriation and commercialisation of in-house research results. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Many forms of technology cycle models have been developed and utilized to identify emergent technologies and forecast social changes, and among these, the technology hype cycle introduced by Gartner has become established as an effective method widely utilized in the field. However, if the hype cycle indeed exists in the various dimensions that constitute the socio-technical system, those who seek to analyze innovative activities using bibliometrics will be confronted with the new problem of actors' choices and the need to analyze their hype cycles. In seeking to overcome such limitations of conventional studies, this paper analyzes the hype cycles of three actors that constitute the core of the socio-technical system through the case study of the successful market entry of hybrid cars. The hype cycle of the user, the first actor, is analyzed based on the search traffic generated by their web searches, and the hype cycle of the producer or researcher, the second actor, is measured based on the data regarding patent applications. Lastly, the hype cycle of the information distributor, namely individuals constituting the market network, is analyzed by examining the exposure in news reports. The outcomes of this research showed that among the three actors, the consumers and the information distributors exhibited hype cycle patterns (bell curves) that were distinct from the market trend, and that there was a difference in time interval of around five quarters. By contrast, it was found that the hype cycle of the producers reflected a logical response, exhibiting a pattern similar to the S-curve during the market's growth period unlike the pattern found in other actors. In conclusion, this study of the particular case of hybrid cars confirmed that the two components of the hype cycle can be respectively verified using consumer search traffic and the patent applications made by the producers. If in the future, such analyses of the hype cycles of producers and consumers are expanded in application to various other industries, it will be possible to obtain more generalizable research outcomes. This is expected to contribute to determining technological life cycles or hype cycles with greater objectivity and efficacy, and furthermore to facilitate the systematic identification of promising technologies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This article describes the latest development of a generic approach to detecting and visualizing emerging trends and transient patterns in scientific literature. The work makes substantial theoretical and methodological contributions to progressive knowledge domain visualization. A specialty is conceptualized and visualized as a time-variant duality between two fundamental concepts in information science: research fronts and intellectual bases. A research front is defined as an emergent and transient grouping of concepts and underlying research issues. The intellectual base of a research front is its citation and co-citation footprint in scientific literature - an evolving network of scientific publications cited by research-front concepts. Kleinberg's (2002) burst-detection algorithm is adapted to identify emergent research-front concepts. Freeman's (1979) betweenness centrality metric is used to highlight potential pivotal points of paradigm shift over time. Two complementary visualization views are designed and implemented: cluster views and time-zone views. The contributions of the approach are that (a) the nature of an intellectual base is algorithmically and temporally identified by emergent research-front terms, (b) the value of a co-citation cluster is explicitly interpreted in terms of research-front concepts, and (c) visually prominent and algorithmically detected pivotal points substantially reduce the complexity of a visualized network. The modeling and visualization process is implemented in CiteSpace II, a Java application, and applied to the analysis of two research fields: mass extinction (1981-2004) and terrorism (1990-2003). Prominent trends and pivotal points in visualized networks were verified in collaboration with domain experts, who are the authors of pivotal-point articles. Practical implications of the work are discussed. A number of challenges and opportunities for future studies are identified.},

abstract = {This article examines the emerging 'technology transfer' role US academics are expected to play in economic development, what specific roles they believe they can play in industrial innovations, and how they might go about collaborating with private industry. Based on a national survey response of approximately 1000 faculty members at research-intensive universities it concludes that US academics in the 1990s believe that they are more favorably disposed than in the 1980s toward closer university-industry collaboration. A majority of the respondents supports the idea that their universities participate actively in local and regional economic development, facilitate commercialization of academic research, and encourage faculty consulting for private firms. A majority of these respondents, however, refuses to support the idea of their universities getting involved in close business partnership with private industry by way of, for example, start-up assistance or equity investment. Of various organizational and motivational underpinnings analyzed from the data, two factors stand out as central to the current debate on university transfer: one is the perception of declining federal R{\&}D support, which threatens the vitality of their research enterprise, and the other is the impact of close university-industry cooperation, which is likely to interfere with academic freedom - the freedom to pursue long-term, disinterested, fundamental research. A search for the boundaries of university-industry collaboration is, therefore, seen as a balancing act between these two competing concerns.},

It serves to establish a foundation for the following empirical and theoretical contributions. Technological inventions are fundamental for a country's economic growth. However, in order to actually generate value for society and profits for the involved companies, these inventions need to be successfully transferred to the market. Therefore, newly developed technologies need to be integrated into products which sell. In particular, our study focuses on the different interaction channels through which technology commercialization occurs. We analyze main groups of institutions, which can either act as developers of technologies and/or organizations bringing these technologies to the market: Universities and research institutes, technology startups, and established companies. We propose a theoretical framework of possible interactions between these organizations and analyze the success factors within the respective channels. Based on the systematic review of 140 articles, key characteristics of the technology development organizations are analyzed with regard to the different possible channels available to commercialize their technology.},

abstract = {Past forecasts of technical innovations include lessons that can be used in making forecasts today. A review of Herman Kahn and Anthony Wiener's "One Hundred Technical Innovations Very Likely in the Last Third of the Twentieth Century," published in their 1967 book, The Year 2000, A Framework for Speculation on the Next Thirty-Three Years, found that fewer than 50{\%} were judged good and timely, having occurred in the twentieth century. However, when the forecasts were grouped into nine broad technological fields, there were wide variations in the judged accuracy of the forecasts. Forecasts in computers and communication stood out as about 80{\%} correct, while forecasts in all other fields were judged to be less than about 50{\%} correct. Sustained trends of increasing capabilities and declining costs of technologies used for computers and communication applications were apparent in 1967 and enabled accurate long-term forecasts. To improve our current forecasts, we should look for sustained and continuing trends in underlying technologies, where increasing capabilities enable more complex applications and declining costs drive a positive innovation loop, lowering the cost of innovation and enabling wider learning and contributions from more people, thus sustaining the technology trends. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {Exchange between science and industry is a prerequisite for innovation (Kaufmann {\&} T{\"{o}}dtling, 2001; Pittaway, Robertson, Munir, Denyer {\&} Neely, 2004) and has attracted considerable interest to the role of relationships and interactions in the process of bringing ideas to the market and commercializing knowledge (Pittaway et al., 2004; Porter {\&} Ketels, 2003; Story, Hart {\&} O'Malley, 2009). Despite enormous government financing, artificially supporting the development of such collaborative partnerships has proved difficult. This study extends industrial marketing's B-2-B model by looking at public sector participants in collaborations in order to examine the process of establishing scientific-knowledge-commercialization collaborations. It is based on 82 interviews in 17 collaborative-research projects in both Ireland and Germany. The findings suggest that retention is a catalyst for improving established collaborations to facilitate the commercialization of scientific knowledge through repeated projects. Retention results from loyal collaborators. Collaborators become loyal and committed because they are content with the overall relationship, commercialization service and quality. It is fundamental that all collaborators understand each other's roles and motive as incongruities hamper the development of productive collaborations. In addition, universities need to develop a greater appreciation of the role of satisfaction. Overall, the study shows the importance of repeat collaborations and the development of mutual benefits which facilitate scientific knowledge commercialization. The study also demonstrates how contextual differences impact on scientific knowledge commercialization in both Ireland and Germany. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

However, there is little empirical evidence to suggest which model to choose. This study attempts to address this gap by examining how characteristics of technologies affect the selection of business models. We consider four characteristics of technology: patent or other legal protection, specialized complementary assets, commercial uncertainty and technological dynamism. We relate these characteristics to the choice of three basic business models for commercializing inventions. Data for this study were gathered for 42 commercialized inventions. We found evidence that greater patent or other legal protection for the technology was associated with a greater likelihood that the technology was commercialized by transferring limited rights to the technology to existing firms. We also found evidence that greater commercial uncertainty was associated with a greater likelihood that the technology was commercialized by creation of a new firm or transfer of the rights to the technology to an existing firm. We did not find evidence of a relationship between the importance of specialized complementary assets or technological dynamism and the business model used. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The results demonstrate that a text-based clustering approach is appropriate for identifying scientific and technological applications for microalgal biofuels. The results indicate that microalgal photosynthesis and light utilization have abundant scientific outcomes for technological engineers to potentially apply. Technological opportunities exist in synthesis, harvesting, extraction, and lipid conversion. Scientific knowledge underlying biofuels accompanying high-value co-products of production require sustained exploration and reporting through research.

The selected domains are research on gallium nitride (GaN) and research on complex networks, which represent recent examples of innovative research. We divided citation networks into clusters using the topological clustering method, tracked the positions of papers in each cluster, and visualized citation networks with characteristic terms for each cluster. Analyzing the clustering results with the average age and parent-children relationship of each cluster may be helpful in detecting emergence. In addition, topological measures, within-cluster degree z and participation coefficient P, succeeded in determining whether there are emerging knowledge clusters. There were at least two types of development of knowledge domains. One is incremental innovation as in GaN and the other is branching innovation as in complex networks. In the domains where incremental innovation occurs, papers changed their position to large z and large P. On the other hand, in the case of branching innovation, they moved to a position with large z and small P, because there is a new emerging cluster, and active research centers shift rapidly. Our results showed that topological measures are beneficial in detecting branching innovation in the citation network of scientific publications. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Scientific research has tended to be more basic, especially in terms of cell design, whereas patents have focused on more applied technology used in solar cell modules. Of the major citation clusters of scientific publications, only two, namely silicon and compound solar cells, corresponded semantically with patent clusters. Conversely, there were no patent clusters corresponding to the other two scientific research fronts, namely dye-sensitized and polymer solar cells.

abstract = {This paper provides a systematized overview of patterns in the scenario planning literature published in the last decades. Recently, scenario planning has enjoyed a revival, apparent in the 'boom' in published research on the matter. Consequently, a major issue that needs to be addressed is how to organize the literature along precise lines. A number of reviews that describe the current status of the body of literature and knowledge on scenario planning have made attempts to respond to such requirements. These studies agree that systematizing the existing literature is a necessary step in developing the field. This paper aims to contribute to this purpose. The review of the academic literature here conducted is thought to be useful for both academics and practitioners. For researchers, this systematic overview will be constructive not only in providing an analysis of the directions of published research but also in setting up a research agenda for the future. For managers and practitioners, it provides a clear outline of firm-related articles and discusses their contribution from a managerial point of view. It also raises awareness with regard to future analytical methods, and in particular, to scenario planning and its potential contribution to the competitiveness of firms. The research was carried out under the research Project Enterprise of the Future of the University of Aveiro. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Each year since 2004, a new Horizon Report has been released. Each edition attempts to forecast the most promising technologies likely to impact on education along three horizons: the short term (the year of the report), the mid-term (the next 2 years) and the long term (the next 4 years). This paper analyzes the evolution of technology trends from 2004 to 2014 that correspond to the long-term predictions of the most recent Horizon Report. The study analyzes through bibliometric analysis which technologies were successful and became a regular part of education systems, which ones failed to have the predicted impact and why, and the shape of technology flows in recent years. The study also shows how the evolution and maturity of some technologies allowed the revival of expectations for others. The analysis here, which focuses on educational applications, offers guidelines that may be helpful to those seeking to invest in new research areas. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper proposes an approach for creating and utilizing keyword-based patent maps for use in new technology creation activity. The proposed approach comprises the following sub-modules. First, text mining is used to transform patent documents into structured data to identify keyword vectors. Second, principal component analysis is employed to reduce the numbers of keyword vectors to make suitable for use on a two-dimensional map. Third, patent 'vacancies', defined as blank areas in the map that are sparse in patent density but large in size, are identified. The validity of the vacancy is then tested against such criteria as technological criticality and technological trends. If a vacancy is judged as meaningful, its technological features are investigated in detail to identify the potential for new technology creation. The procedure of the proposed approach is described in detail by employing an illustrative patent database and is implemented into an expert system for new technology creation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We have devised a 10-step framework based on extensive Future-oriented Technology Analyses ("FTA") experience, enriched by in-depth case analyses. In the paper, we describe our analytical activities in two case studies. The nanobiosensor experience is contrasted with that of deep brain stimulation in relative quantitative and qualitative emphases.

More recently several significant shifts in university patenting behavior have led to the disappearance of this difference. Thus our results suggest that between 1965 and 1988 the rate of increase of important patents from universities was much less than their overall rate of increase of patenting.},

The analysis of 1021 R{\&}D units, each distinguished by its main orientation towards either research or development work, reveals that research is concentrated in only five regions worldwide, while development is more globally dispersed. Our research is based on 290 research interviews and database research in 81 technology-intensive multinational companies. We identify two principal location rationales—access to markets and access to science—as the principal determinants for four trends that lead to four archetypes of R{\&}D internationalization: ‘national treasure', ‘market-driven', ‘technology-driven', and ‘global'. Their organizational evolution is characterized by four trends. The model is illustrated with short cases of international R{\&}D organization at Kubota, Schindler, Xerox, and Glaxo-Wellcome. Differences in R{\&}D internationalization drivers lead to a separation of individual R{\&}D units by geography and organization. Current belief is to integrate R{\&}D processes; separation seems to contradict this trend. We argue that this need not be the case, for there are good reasons to maintain some independence between research and development.},

This scientometric approach uses the most suitable keywords linked to the technology in question and determines the number of publications and patents in those fields for a given year. Database analysis of publications and patents in the previous 11 years indicates that while the majority of the top 20 technologies identified by the experts are indeed emerging (i.e. the number of research and/or patenting in these technologies is increasing), some of them have not actually attracted too much interest in the science and technology (S{\&}T) community. Forecasts based on S-curves indicate steady growth in some of the selected technologies. There is a high correlation between the number of scientific publications and patents in most of the technologies investigated. The method is proposed as a simple and efficient tool to link national foresight efforts to international S{\&}T activities and to obtain quantitative information for prioritized technologies that could be used for technology management and decision making for research funding and technology investment. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A major problem for firms making information technology investment decisions is predicting and understanding the effects of future technological developments on the value of present technologies. Failure to adequately address this problem can result in wasted organization resources in ac-quiring, developing, managing, and training employees in the use of technologies that are short-lived and fail to produce adequate return on investment. The sheer number of avail-able technologies and the complex set of relationships among them make IT landscape analysis extremely challenging. Most IT-consuming firms rely on third parties and suppliers for strategic recommendations on IT investments, which can lead to biased and generic advice. We address this problem by defining a new set of constructs and methodologies upon which we develop an IT ecosystem model. The objective of these artifacts is to provide a formal problem representation structure for the analysis of information technology devel-opment trends and to reduce the complexity of the IT landscape for practitioners making IT investment decisions.

It takes a closer look at the case of stationary fuel cells, for which a hype could be identified in 2001 followed by a clear downscaling of expectations and disappointment. Innovation activities, however, remained largely unaffected by the disap- pointment.We offer two explanations. First, only generalised expectations were adjusted after the hype, while overarching expectations (frames) remained stable and continued to legitimate the technology. Second, emerging institutional structures lead to increasing positive external- ities thus stabilising ongoing innovation activities. These institutionalisation processes, again, were supported by a transformation of promises into requirements during the hype and the fact that the frames continued to legitimise the technology afterwards.We conclude with the proposition to differentiate disappointments according to which type of expectations changes after the hype.},

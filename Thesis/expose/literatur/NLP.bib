abstract = {As the prevalence of social media on the Internet, opinion mining has become an essential approach to analyzing so many data. Various applications appear in a wide range of industrial domains. Meanwhile, opinions have diverse expressions which bring along research challenges. Both of the practical demands and research challenges make opinion mining an active research area in recent years. In this paper, we present a review of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for opinion mining. First, we introduce general NLP techniques which are required for text preprocessing. Second, we investigate the approaches of opinion mining for different levels and situations. Then we introduce comparative opinion mining and deep learning approaches for opinion mining. Opinion summarization and advanced topics are introduced later. Finally, we discuss some challenges and open problems related to opinion mining.},

abstract = {Online communities displaying textual postings require measures to combat information overload. One popular approach is to ask participants whether or not messages are helpful in order to then guide others to interesting content. Adopting a well-established framework for assessing data quality, we examine the nature of “helpfulness.” We study consumer reviews at Amazon.com, deriving 22 measures quantifying their textual properties, authors' reputations and product characteristics. Confirmatory factor analysis reveals five underlying quality dimensions representing reviewers' reputations in the community, the topical relevancy of the reviews, the ease of understanding them, their believability and objectivity. A correlation and regression analysis confirms that these dimensions are related to the helpfulness scores assigned by community participants. However, it also uncovers a strong relationship between the chronological ordering of reviews and helpfulness, which both community participants and designers should keep in mind when using this method of social navigation.},

abstract = {Twitter is a microblog service that generates a huge amount of textual content daily. All this content needs to be explored by means of text mining, natural language processing, information retrieval, and other techniques. In this context, automatic keyword extraction is a task of great usefulness. A fundamental step in text mining techniques consists of building a model for text representation. The model known as vector space model, VSM, is the most well-known and used among these techniques. However, some difficulties and limitations of VSM, such as scalability and sparsity, motivate the proposal of alternative approaches. This paper proposes a keyword extraction method for tweet collections that represents texts as graphs and applies centrality measures for finding the relevant vertices (keywords). To assess the performance of the proposed approach, three different sets of experiments are performed. The first experiment applies TKG to a text from the Time magazine and compares its performance with that of the literature. The second set of experiments takes tweets from three different TV shows, applies TKG and compares it with TFIDF and KEA, having human classifications as benchmarks. Finally, these three algorithms are applied to tweets sets of increasing size and their computational running time is measured and compared. Altogether, these experiments provide a general overview of how TKG can be used in practice, its performance when compared with other standard approaches, and how it scales to larger data instances. The results show that TKG is a novel and robust proposal to extract keywords from texts, particularly from short messages, such as tweets. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The use of social media has become an integral part of daily routine in modern society. Social media portals offer powerful public platforms where people can freely share their opinions and feelings about various topics with large crowds. In the current study, we investigated the public opinions and sentiments towards the Syrian refugee crisis, which has affected millions of people and has become a widely discussed, polarizing topic in social media around the world. To analyze public sentiments about the topic on Twitter, we collected a total of 2381,297 relevant tweets in two languages including Turkish and English. Turkish sentiments were considered important as Turkey has welcomed the largest number of Syrian refugees and Turkish tweets carried information to reflect public perception of a refugee hosting country first handedly. We performed a comparative sentiment analysis of retrieved tweets. The results indicated that the sentiments in Turkish tweets were significantly different from the sentiments in English tweets. We found that Turkish tweets carried slightly more positive sentiments towards Syrians and refugees than neutral and negative sentiments, nevertheless the sentiments of tweets were almost evenly distributed among the three major categories. On the other hand, the largest number of English tweets by a significant margin contained neutral sentiments, which was followed by the negative sentiments. In comparison to the ratio of positive sentiments in Turkish tweets, 35{\%} of all Turkish tweets, the proportion of English tweets contained remarkably less positive sentiments towards Syrians and refugees, only 12{\%} of all English tweets.},

@article{Hofmann2001,
abstract = {This paper presents a novel statistical method for factor analysis of binary and count data which is closely related to a technique known as Latent Semantic Analysis. In contrast to the latter method which stems from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed technique uses a generative latent class model to perform a probabilistic mixture decomposition. This results in a more principled approach with a solid foundation in statistical inference. More precisely, we propose to make use of a temperature controlled version of the Expectation Maximization algorithm for model fitting, which has shown excellent performance in practice. Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis has many applications, most prominently in information retrieval, natural language processing, machine learning from text, and in related areas. The paper presents perplexity results for different types of text and linguistic data collections and discusses an application in automated document indexing. The experiments indicate substantial and consistent improvements of the probabilistic method over standard Latent Semantic Analysis.},

abstract = {Recommender systems use algorithms to provide users with product or service recommendations. Recently, these systems have been using machine learning algorithms from the field of artificial intelligence. However, choosing a suitable machine learning algorithm for a recommender system is difficult because of the number of algorithms described in the literature. Researchers and practitioners developing recommender systems are left with little information about the current approaches in algorithm usage. Moreover, the development of recommender systems using machine learning algorithms often faces problems and raises questions that must be resolved. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature that analyzes the use of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems and identifies new research opportunities. The goals of this study are to (i) identify trends in the use or research of machine learning algorithms in recommender systems; (ii) identify open questions in the use or research of machine learning algorithms; and (iii) assist new researchers to position new research activity in this domain appropriately. The results of this study identify existing classes of recommender systems, characterize adopted machine learning approaches, discuss the use of big data technologies, identify types of machine learning algorithms and their application domains, and analyzes both main and alternative performance metrics.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis is one of the fastest growing research areas in computer science, making it challenging to keep track of all the activities in the area. We present a computer-assisted literature review, where we utilize both text mining and qualitative coding, and analyze 6,996 papers from Scopus. We find that the roots of sentiment analysis are in the studies on public opinion analysis at the beginning of 20th century and in the text subjectivity analysis performed by the computational linguistics community in 1990's. However, the outbreak of computer-based sentiment analysis only occurred with the availability of subjective texts on the Web. Consequently, 99{\%} of the papers have been published after 2004. Sentiment analysis papers are scattered to multiple publication venues, and the combined number of papers in the top-15 venues only represent ca. 30{\%} of the papers in total. We present the top-20 cited papers from Google Scholar and Scopus and a taxonomy of research topics. In recent years, sentiment analysis has shifted from analyzing online product reviews to social media texts from Twitter and Facebook. Many topics beyond product reviews like stock markets, elections, disasters, medicine, software development and cyberbullying extend the utilization of sentiment analysis},

abstract = {Abstract Interest in Opinion Mining has been growing steadily in the last years, mainly because of its great number of applications and the scientific challenge it poses. Accordingly, the resources and techniques to help tackle the problem are many, and most of the latest work fuses them at some stage of the process. However, this combination is usually executed without following any defined guidelines and overlooking the possibility of replicating and improving it, hence the need for a deeper understanding of the fusion process becomes apparent. Information Fusion is the field charged with researching efficient methods for transforming information from different sources into a single coherent representation, and therefore can be used to guide fusion processes in Opinion Mining. In this paper we present a survey on Information Fusion applied to Opinion Mining. We first define Opinion Mining and describe its most fundamental aspects, later explain Information Fusion and finally review several Opinion Mining studies that rely at some point on the fusion of information.},

abstract = {In the field of geographic information science, modeling geographic dynamics based on spatiotemporal information extracted from the Web, especially unconstructed data such as online news reports, is a growing area of research. Extracting spatiotemporal and semantic information from a set of Web documents enables us to build a rich representation of geographic knowledge described in text, capturing where, when, or what events have occurred. This work investigates the role ontologies play as a key component in the process of semantic information extraction. We show how ontologies can be used in conjunction with natural language gazetteers in order to process semantic information about hazard events and augment spatiotemporal extraction with semantics. We are interested in capturing the spatiotemporal patterns of hazard-related events from online news reports to track the occurrences and evolution of natural hazards, such as severe storms. A hazard ontology has been created to assist the spatiotemporal information extraction process, especially with the automatic detection of different kinds of events at multiple granularities from unstructured texts revealing relationships between the events over space-time. The extraction and retrieval of semantic information about event dynamics provides information about the progression of events using both natural and human perspectives.},

Taking advantage of the amount of information is now available, research and industry have sought ways to automatically analyze sentiments and user opinions expressed in social networks. In this paper, we place ourselves in a difficult context, on the sentiments that could thinking of suicide. In particular, we propose to address the lack of terminological resources related to suicide by a method of constructing a vocabulary associated with suicide. We then propose, for a better analysis, to investigate Weka as a tool of data mining based on machine learning algorithms that can extract useful information from Twitter data collected by Twitter4J. Therefore, an algorithm of computing semantic analysis between tweets in training set and tweets in data set based on WordNet is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that our method based on machine learning algorithms and semantic sentiment analysis can extract predictions of suicidal ideation using Twitter Data. In addition, this work verify the effectiveness of performance in term of accuracy and precision on semantic sentiment analysis that could thinking of suicide.},
